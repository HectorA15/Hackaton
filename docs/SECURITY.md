# Security Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the security measures implemented in the Inventory Expiry Tracker application and the vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed during development.

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **JWT-based Authentication**
   - Secure token generation with configurable expiration (24 hours)
   - Bearer token authentication for all protected endpoints

2. **Password Security**
   - bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for password storage
   - No plaintext passwords stored in database

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Three roles: Admin, Manager, Worker
   - Granular permissions per endpoint
   - Middleware-enforced authorization

### API Security

1. **Helmet.js Security Headers**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) configured
   - XSS protection enabled
   - Other security headers properly set

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Static files: 200 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Prevents brute force and DoS attacks

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing properly configured
   - Prevents unauthorized cross-domain requests

4. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated on backend
   - GTIN format validation (8, 12, 13, or 14 digits)
   - File upload validation (type and size)
   - SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

### File Upload Security

1. **File Type Validation**
   - Only image files allowed (jpeg, jpg, png, gif)
   - MIME type and extension validation

2. **File Size Limits**
   - Maximum 5MB per file
   - Prevents storage exhaustion attacks

3. **Path Traversal Prevention**
   - Filename sanitization with `path.basename()`
   - Real path verification before file deletion
   - Files restricted to upload directory

### Frontend Security

1. **XSS Prevention**
   - HTML escaping for all dynamic content
   - `escapeHtml()` utility function for user-generated content
   - Proper encoding of URL parameters

2. **URL Parameter Sanitization**
   - Whitelist validation for filter parameters
   - URI component encoding for query strings

### External API Security

1. **Request Forgery Prevention**
   - GTIN format validation before API calls
   - Timeout configuration for external requests
   - Error handling for failed API calls

### Audit & Monitoring

1. **Audit Logging**
   - All CRUD operations logged
   - User actions tracked with IP addresses
   - Entity changes recorded with timestamps

2. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages without sensitive information
   - Console logging for debugging (disabled in production)

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### During Development

1. **XSS Vulnerability (js/xss-through-dom)**
   - **Issue**: DOM text reinterpreted as HTML without escaping
   - **Location**: public/js/app.js
   - **Fix**: Implemented `escapeHtml()` function and applied to all dynamic content
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

2. **Path Injection (js/path-injection)**
   - **Issue**: File paths influenced by user input in upload handler
   - **Location**: src/routes/inventory.js
   - **Fix**: Added real path verification and upload directory validation
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

3. **Request Forgery (js/request-forgery)**
   - **Issue**: External API URL construction with unvalidated user input
   - **Location**: src/utils/externalApi.js
   - **Fix**: Added GTIN format validation with regex
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

4. **Insecure Helmet Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Content Security Policy disabled
   - **Location**: src/server.js
   - **Fix**: Properly configured CSP with appropriate directives
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

5. **Missing Rate Limiting**
   - **Issue**: Static file route not rate-limited
   - **Location**: src/server.js
   - **Fix**: Added separate rate limiter for static files
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Known Limitations

1. **SQLite Concurrency**
   - SQLite has limited concurrent write support
   - For high-traffic deployments, consider PostgreSQL or MySQL

2. **Local File Storage**
   - Files stored locally on server filesystem
   - For distributed systems, consider cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob)

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT tokens cannot be revoked before expiration
   - For immediate revocation needs, implement token blacklist

4. **Offline Sync**
   - Basic conflict resolution implemented
   - Complex scenarios may require manual intervention

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate

1. ✅ Change default JWT secret to a strong random value
2. ✅ Enable HTTPS with proper SSL/TLS certificates
3. ✅ Keep dependencies updated (`npm audit` and `npm update`)
4. ✅ Regular database backups

### Short-term

1. Implement token refresh mechanism
2. Add token blacklist for logout functionality
3. Implement password complexity requirements
4. Add password reset functionality
5. Enable two-factor authentication for admin users

### Long-term

1. Migrate to production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
2. Implement cloud storage for uploads
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Compliance

The application implements basic security measures suitable for internal use. For compliance with specific standards (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), additional measures may be required:

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Privacy controls and consent management
- Detailed access logging and reporting
- Regular security assessments

## Security Testing

All code has been scanned with:
- ✅ ESLint for code quality
- ✅ CodeQL for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Manual security review
- ✅ Unit tests for critical functionality

Final CodeQL scan: **0 security alerts** ✅
